# Wing-Integrated-Wind-Turbines-Feasibility
This repository contains all my research on different types of wind turbines to integrate into a plane wing and how that affects power output of the turbine itself. It does not look at aerodynamic efficiency, effect on normal airplane mechanics, or where on the back of the wing the turbines should be placed (this comes in my next study).
